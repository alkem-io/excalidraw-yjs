 *
 * `protectedIds` (Fix #3) — fileIds still referenced by SOME element in the
 * scene/doc, INCLUDING soft-deleted (tombstoned) image elements. A protected id
 * is NEVER deleted even when it is absent from the `files` arg, because:
 *  - during async image loading `files` is transiently partial (the binary has
 *    not finished loading), so a benign local `onChange` would otherwise delete
 *    a binary the doc still needs; and
 *  - a tombstoned image still references its file, so file lifecycle must follow
 *    element soft-delete, not the live `files` map.
 * When omitted (e.g. the populate path), behaviour is unchanged.
