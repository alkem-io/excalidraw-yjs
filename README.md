## Alkemio fork of Excalidraw

### List of differences with standard Excalidraw

- Selected from a non-yet-released Excalidraw version that is already upgraded to React 19.
- Added ZoomToFit button to the zoom toolbar.
- Modified the paste functionality to avoid pasting elements (such as images) as JSON when editing text.
- Changed the toolbar Lock button behavior. Now it locks/unlocks elements instead of the tool in use.
- Changed the load from file behavior to fix multi-user collaboration bug. Now elements loaded will be inserted in the current scene instead of replacing all the elements of the scene.
- Added emoji insert tool.
- Added emoji realtime reaction broadcast tool.
- Added a shared broadcasted countdown timer tool.
- ~~ZoomToFit feature exposed through the external API~~ not anymore
- ~~Added ZoomToFit flag to initialData to fit items on load~~ not anymore
- ~~Added `hideLibraryButton` to the appState to be able to hide the button from outside~~ not anymore

### Testing locally inside Alkemio client

Checkout both projects Alkemio `client-web` and `excalidraw-fork` in the same folder, and modify Alkemio's package.json:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@excalidraw-yjs/excalidraw": "../excalidraw-fork/packages/excalidraw",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

The excalidraw package needs to be built:

```bash
cd excalidraw-fork
# Maybe not needed - Excalidraw requires Node 18.0.0 - 22.x.x by the time of writing this
nvm use 22
# Cleans up any previous builds
yarn rm:build
# Cleans up any previously installed packages
yarn rm:node_modules
# Build Excalidraw package
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build:package
```

Then run `pnpm install` on the client.

### Developing/debugging Excalidraw standalone

Excalidraw comes with a test application which loads a whiteboard in the browser's local storage and renders just the Excalidraw component. It can be run at

```bash
cd packages/excalidraw
yarn
yarn start
```

### Developer Notes

- All our modifications are merged to `develop` branch.
- `master` branch is the original Excalidraw's `master` branch as is. By the time of writing this readme, it is unstable and shouldn't be released to production.
- Some tags and branches are kept in the repo from previous versions released, but before version 0.18.0 we were not following the instructions in this Readme, so things may be inconsistent.
- The version naming is as follows: vX.X.X-HHHHH-alkemio-R. Being X the original version of the Excalidraw's package, HHHHH the hash of the last commit applied (if any, normally we just release the Excalidraw's released commit, so this HHHHH is omitted), and R is the counter of released Alkemio packages.

### Upgrade procedure

Everytime Excalidraw releases a new package, they publish it in their [GitHub/releases](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/releases), Github indicates in which commit they have based the release. For example release 0.18.0 is based on commit 817d8c553c3389650f8b4503984a6d4a5d2f0c11 If we want to base our release on a later commit applied in their master branch, we also can, but we have made the agreement of appending that hash to the package name (that's the appended hash -HHHHH-)

```bash
  git fetch --tags upstream
  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>
  # example:
  # git checkout -b 0.18.0-alkemio-8 817d8c553c3389650f8b4503984a6d4a5d2f0c11  (taken from Excalidraw's GitHub releases page, or a later commit to their master branch)

  # Then merge the Alkemio changes from our branch: develop
  git merge origin/develop
  # Solve the conflicts.
  # Make sure packages/excalidraw/package.json has the correct package version number.
  # Increase the suffix for example: -alkemio-8 => -alkemio-9
  # 0.18.0 Same as the Excalidraw's released package where we base our release
  # -817d8c5 The commit hash, if we want to apply any later commits merged after the Excalidraw's release
  # example: 0.18.0-alkemio-8
  #      or: 0.18.0-817d8c5-alkemio-8

  git commit -am "Alkemio Release <new-branch-name>"
  # example: git commit -am "Alkemio Release 0.18.0-alkemio-8"

  # Then push
  git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>
  # example: git push -u origin 0.18.0-alkemio-8
```

Create a Pull Request to develop in excalidraw-fork repository

### Automatic build and publish the new npm package (✅ preferred method)

- Update manually the version number in `packages/excalidraw/package.json` - See versioning conventions before.
- Make sure all your changes are merged to develop, although a different branch can be selected for the release for testing purposes.
- Draft a new Release in the [releases page](https://github.com/alkem-io/excalidraw-fork/releases).
  - Create a new tag `v${package.json version}` and select the branch from which you want to release.
  - Set the title for this release.
  - Auto generate release notes.
  - Publish the release.
- The [action](https://github.com/alkem-io/excalidraw-fork/actions/workflows/release-alkemio.yml) should run automatically
- The package should appear in [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw-yjs/excalidraw) shortly
- Create a PR on the client using the new package, change package.json to the new version and don't forget to run `pnpm i`.

##### GitHub and NPM configuration for the automatic publishing

- Github's: alkem-io/excalidraw-fork repository has been added as Trusted Publisher in the npmjs repository to be able to publish from the GitHub Actions without tokens.

### Manually build locally and publish the new npm package (❌ see before, the preferred method)

Verify in `packages/excalidraw/package.json` the version of the package to be published `'alkemio-X'` and make sure the version matches the number that should be published. `yarn:publish` is going to ask for the version number again and it can bump the number but you can just repeat the current version number if it's correct.

```bash
yarn
cd packages/excalidraw
yarn install
yarn build:esm
yarn pack
yarn publish
```
